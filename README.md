Asaitec proof of concept

I have tried to elaborate the proposed exercise in the best possible way, I hope that you appreciate it as a whole and you will like it.

First of all, I have decided to use a single class because the proposed exercise was simple, I have not seen necessary at this time the elaboration of classes such as Fruits.java, Purchases.java or Offers.java, although it is possible that in a real scenario where the product had a wide prospective it would be necessary something like that.

I have tried to read the files as quickly as possible, so I have used the comma symbol (",") to separate the information, something I would like to change in the future to make it more secure and robust.

I have used very similar functions both to read fruits and their prices, as well as purchases and offers, so in a real scenario I would like to be able to spend some time to remove the duplicity of the code and possibly make a single function to read files with similar format.

I have not performed any testing (other than switching between different input files to check, as I coded, that the result was correct). With more time and in a real scenario I would have liked to elaborate first the unitary tests (with a good amount of input files) to later dedicate the time to code the exercise, however this would not have been possible in 3 hours, so I preferred to dispense with such exhaustive tests.

In last term, I would like to delve into the offers and their format, since this is a very extensive requirement with a very high potential, so in 3 hours it would be impossible for me to decide a good data structure that contemplates all the formats of the possible offers, so for now the offers are not automatically applied in the program, and will only be shown in the output when the fruit to which they apply has been purchased, as a simple String.
